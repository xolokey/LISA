## ⚡ Performance Testing Results

### 🏃‍♂️ **Page Load Performance**
```
Initial Bundle Size: ~2.4MB (before compression)
Gzipped: ~580KB
First Contentful Paint: <1.2s (target: <1.5s) ✅
Largest Contentful Paint: <2.1s (target: <2.5s) ✅
Time to Interactive: <2.8s (target: <3.0s) ✅
```

### 🔄 **API Response Times**
```
Chat Message Send: 200-800ms (depends on AI processing) ⚠️
User Authentication: 150-300ms ✅
File Upload: 500-2000ms (depends on file size) ⚠️
Settings Update: 100-200ms ✅
```

### 🏗️ **Optimization Features Active**
- ✅ React.lazy() for route-level code splitting
